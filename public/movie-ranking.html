    <h1>The Best Movies According to Fathima</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
    <hr>

    <h3>Om Shanti Om</h3>
    <p>My favorite childhood film. The songs are amazing and I just love SRK-Deepika. In my opinion, OSO is one of the finest Bollywood movies of the 2000s era.</p>

    <h3>Tangled</h3>
    <p>My favorite Disney Princess movie. I love Rapunzal's character(she's my fav Disney princess obviously) and all the other characters are great as well especially Eugene/Flynn Rider. Their romance is so sweet and the soundtrack is also really good. I especially adore "I see the light".</p>
